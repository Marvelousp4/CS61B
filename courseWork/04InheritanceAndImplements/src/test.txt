When I was a young boy, I lived in a poor family. My father is a drinker and always played with his computer. His only acheivement is help me touch the Internet at a young age. Most of children get addicted with computer game and I'm not an exception. Fortuanately at the same time, I catch the only chance to explore the wonderful world. Later, I study well and can get out of the countryside.
